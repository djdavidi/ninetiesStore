    	In 1999, Josh, David, Will, and Luis all cried their eyes out when they heard that
    	their precious decade would end within the year. They didn't take the last ten years
    	for granted, as so many of us did during that epoch. On December 31st, 1999, while all
    	of the world worried about being kasploded by some computer, they decided to save their
    	favorite relics in a time capsule buried beneath the grave of Kurt Kobain. After some
    	alleged graverobbing charges, these men finally dug up their lost capsule and decided to
    	share the joy with the world by selling on some website. Enjoy our arsenal of stuff, and
    	feel the nostalgia coarsing through your veins!
